# **COMPOSITE PATTERN**
-----------------------
he Composite pattern is really quite simple.
Sometimes we need to model objects that naturally group themselves into larger
components. These more complex objects fit into the Composite pattern if they
share some characteristics with the individual components: The whole looks a lot like
one of the parts. The Composite pattern lets us build arbitrarily deep trees of objects in which we can treat any of the interior nodes—the composites—just like any of the
leaf nodes.
