------------------------------------

The important thing about the abstract factory
is that it encapsulates the knowledge of which product types go together. You can
express that encapsulation with classes and subclasses, or you can get to it by storing the
class objects as we did in the code above. Either way, you end up with an object that
knows which kind of things belong together
